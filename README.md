Diglot is a Free and Open-Source 'App' that can run on :

* Windows 64
* MacOS
* iOS
* Android

Unfortunately  Diglot cannot run on Linux, right now :-( .

Diglot is published under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL3). The sources can be got on [Github](https://github.com/Canardoux/dark_diglot).

The purpose of Diglot is to test and improve the vocabulary knowledge of a user, for his foreign language.

Diglot uses one or more external dictionary. Actually, the dictionary used is a Korean/English one. It is also free and open source :
https://github.com/Canardoux/kengdic. Unfortunately this dictionary is not very good, and another one is currently in progress.
An English/Japanese dictionary is also considered for a next futur.

Diglot uses a clever algorithm that can track the user's level and acts according to his progress. Diglot is inspired by a a nice App that was present on the Apple App Store sometimes ago, but this application seems to be dead, not maintained and cannot run on a modern 64 bits device [*Ref. needed!*]. More, this application was not free and probably not open sourced.

Internally, Diglot uses the great Un4seen Bass Library to play and record vocal sounds. Unfortunately this library is free but not Open-Source, but I did not found another free library that can solved my various requests. 

Diglot is built with the Delphi RAD. I am considering a port to Lazarus (a very nice Free/Open-Source platform) but this port will need some real work and I am not sure to have the necessary energy for that (maybe someone else can do that ?).
